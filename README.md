# A Traveller's Notebook

This is a note-taking application built using JavaScript and the [Leaflet Library](https://leafletjs.com/). With this app, users can easily create and save notes that are associated with specific coordinates. The application provides a simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to enter the details of their notes, including the location where the note was created or about which the note was created.

The app stores all the notes and associated location information in local storage. This ensures that users can easily access their notes whenever they need them. Additionally, the app has been designed to be lightweight and fast, ensuring that it runs smoothly on all devices, including mobile devices.

This project is inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann's Mapty project. However, the app has a different user interface and feature set, and the implementation details have been modified and expanded.

**This is my Leaflet project and the 27th project so far.**
